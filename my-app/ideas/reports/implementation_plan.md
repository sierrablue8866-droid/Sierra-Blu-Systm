---

## 🛑 Open Questions (User Review Required)
1. **WhatsApp Scraper**: Which tool are you using to push group messages to the system? I will build the `/api/webhook/whatsapp` endpoint to receive them.
2. **OpenClaw Sales Script**: Can you provide the text of the sales script for better AI tuning?
3. **Google API Credentials**: Should I expect a Service Account JSON for Sheets/Calendar?
4. **Broker_Listings Migration**: Should I move existing data in `listings` to the new structure now?

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Test parsing regex and Gemini logic with raw WhatsApp messages.
- Verify Firestore triggers for `lastUpdated` and `KPI` updates.
### Manual Verification
- Deploy UI components and verify Luxury Typography (Cinzel/Noto) in the dashboard.
- Simulate WhatsApp webhook for lead classification.
